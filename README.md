# Gen-AI-Stock-Portfolio
Main Idea: A project where I understood the code, but not the financial terms lol

I was following along with a course which was using ChatGPT as a LLM; however I used DeepSeek via OpenRouter for this project because it was free. For this very reason, my answers may have turned out to be completely different than the provided outputs (from the course) at times. Although I tried my best with the starter file, the outcome of the final file did not reach my expectations. Nonetheless, everything works.
